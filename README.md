# subdim-mardia
 The `Rcpp` file `SkewKurt.cpp` contains the functions **asymskewness**, **asymkurtosis**, **asymskewness_q** and **asymkurtosis_q**, which compute the p-values of the tests described in the paper [Sub-Dimensional Mardia Measures of Multivariate Skewness and Kurtosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14441). **asymskewness** and **asymkurtosis** compute the p-values of the tests of skewness and kurtosis, respectively, based on the complete vectors of all subdimensional Mardia measures of skewness and kurtosis. On the other hand, **asymskewness_q** and **asymkurtosis_q** compute the p-values of the tests of skewness and kurtosis based on the respective vectors of only the _q_-dimensional Mardia measures of skewness and kurtosis.
